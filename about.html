  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>Hello, I'm Cassie Wang. I'm a web designer/developer.</p>

  <p>My first contact with computers went way back to the late 90s when the DOS system was still in use. I developed my typing skill on it. Since then, I have considered myself "tech-savvy" and learned how to utilize mirror documents and virtual CD to play with my favorite video game, the sims, and use virtual proxy servers to access its foreign forums while in middle school. Being a user, I have enjoyed the many ways tech has benefited my life. The idea of being a part of the source of magic makes me feel very excited.</p>
