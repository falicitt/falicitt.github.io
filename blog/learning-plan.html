  <p>My long term career goal is to either be a web developer or a UX designer. Being a freelancer is not a bad idea.</p>

  <p>My strengths regarding studying is that I'm usually quite organized and patient. I do not give up easily when the problem is hard to solve. My limitation is that I'm not that good at logic thinking, and math is not my best subject. Non-technical wise, I would like to open up myself a bit more while studying in dev academy, to build confidence from internal, and to reach out to others even when it's not absolutely necessary. </p>

  <p>I will try my best to finish the due workload within each sprint. It has been emphasized clearly that the workload in dev academy is pretty heavy. So I have been mentally preparing myself for it. Personally I feel it has been going smoothly in the first two sprints, so I still have some extra energy to manage my other study and work. In the case it gets heavier in the future, I will dedicate my full attention to it. In the meantime, I will try to seek help from my peers and facilitators, also try to work together with them, see if that will help us save some time. 
  </p>

  <p>Another important point is to work out which is the more important task therefore deserves more time, and which is just silly bugs or technical problems that we should ask facilitator's help to save time in order to spend more energy on the more important issues. </p>
  
  <p>As for the lovely facilitators, I expect them to be my guidance when I'm lost. I imagine I could encounter some very specific problems while doing projects in the future. I could watch a dozen tutorials on YouTube, but still can't find the answer to my problem. This is when I would go to facilitators for help. Or when I can't make up my mind when there are several options to choose from, I will also seek suggestions from professional opinions.
  </p>

  <p> Last but not least, currently I don't have anything to block my time out from study.
