  <h2>My Foundation Learning Plan</h2>
  <p>My long term career goal is to either be a web developer or a UX designer. Being a freelancer is not a bad idea.</p>

  <p>My strengths regarding studying is that I'm usually quite organized and patient. I do not give up easily when the problem is hard to solve. My limitation is that I'm not that good at logic thinking, and math is not my best subject. Non-technical wise, I would like to open up myself a bit more while studying in dev academy, to build confidence from internal, and to reach out to others even when it's not absolutely necessary. </p>

  <p>I will try my best to finish the due workload within each sprint. It has been emphasized clearly that the workload in dev academy is pretty heavy. So I have been mentally preparing myself for it. Personally I feel it has been going smoothly in the first two sprints, so I still have some extra energy to manage my other study and work. In the case it gets heavier in the future, I will dedicate my full attention to it. In the meantime, I will try to seek help from my peers and facilitators, also try to work together with them, see if that will help us save some time. 
  </p>

  <p>Another important point is to work out which is the more important task therefore deserves more time, and which is just silly bugs or technical problems that we should ask facilitator's help to save time in order to spend more energy on the more important issues. </p>
  
  <p>As for the lovely facilitators, I expect them to be my guidance when I'm lost. I imagine I could encounter some very specific problems while doing projects in the future. I could watch a dozen tutorials on YouTube, but still can't find the answer to my problem. This is when I would go to facilitators for help. Or when I can't make up my mind when there are several options to choose from, I will also seek suggestions from professional opinions.
  </p>

  <p> 
    Last but not least, currently I don't have anything to block my time out from study. 
  </p>

  <h2>My Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
<p>
  With the knowledge and skills I learnt and will be learning from DevAcademy, I just hope that I could change my career path and become a web designer or developer. I don't have a further goal in my mind yet. One step at a time.
</p>
<p>
  My biggest strength would be my passion, my determination and my time-management skills. I think these will help me greatly in completing the tasks in bootcamp. My biggest limitation could be to express my ideas in a group. Sometimes I could be not so good at expressing myself. So even if I have a good idea I could have difficulty describing it to others.
</p>
<p>
  I think my non-technical challenge would be public speaking. Also working in groups, especially I need to learn how to have challenging conversations with other people. Before I tend to avoid it and it could make our team work not so efficient as it could be. Therefore, I would like to learn the skills and strategies for challenging conversations. I would also like to see myself building more confidence from all aspects.
</p>
<p>
  My expectations for the Bootcamp team is to be easy to reach when I need help. I imagine we students will ask a lot of questions in bootcamp and facilitators could be very busy. When I have a problem I will discuss with other students first. If still no success, I would expect the facilitators will have time to guide me through the problem.
</p>
<p>
  As mentioned in the previous learning plan, I will dedicate my full attention and energy on this course when the workload gets high. I don't really have any other duties that would block my time from study at the moment. I am determined and I'm good at time management. I can usually manage to deliver the required work on time, as what I proudly did in the foundation course.  Therefore, I have the confidence that I will do my best to finish the workload in Bootcamp.
