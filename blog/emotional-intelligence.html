    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>Emotional intelligence (EI, also known as emotional quotient or EQ), refers to the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions. People with a relatively high EQ are able to relieve stress in positive ways, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.</p>
    
    <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
    <p>IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. </p>
    <p>EQ tests measure your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.</p>
    <p>A higher emotional intelligence can help us in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Being able to accept criticism and responsibility
      </li>
      <li>
        Being able to move on after making a mistake
      </li>
      <li>
        Being able to say no when you need to
      </li>
      <li>
        Being able to share your feelings with others
      </li>
      <li>
        Being able to solve problems in ways that work for everyone
      </li>
      <li>
        Having empathy for other people
      </li>
      <li>
        Having great listening skills
      </li>
      <li>
        Knowing why you do the things you do
      </li>
      <li>
        Not being judgmental of others
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <p>As we know, it’s not the smartest people who are the most successful or the most fulfilled in life. You probably know people who are academically brilliant and yet are socially inept and unsuccessful at work or in their personal relationships. Intellectual ability or your intelligence quotient (IQ) isn’t enough on its own to achieve success in life. Yes, your IQ can help you get into college, but it’s your EQ that will help you manage the stress and emotions when facing your final exams. IQ and EQ exist in tandem and are most effective when they build off one another.</p>
    <p>Emotional intelligence affects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your performance at school or work. High emotional intelligence can help you navigate the social complexities of the workplace, lead and motivate others, and excel in your career. In fact, when it comes to gauging important job candidates, many companies now rate emotional intelligence as important as technical ability and employ EQ testing before hiring.   
      </li>
      <li>
        Your physical health. If you’re unable to manage your emotions, you are probably not managing your stress either. This can lead to serious health problems. Uncontrolled stress raises blood pressure, suppresses the immune system, increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes, contributes to infertility, and speeds up the aging process. The first step to improving emotional intelligence is to learn how to manage stress.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your mental health. Uncontrolled emotions and stress can also impact your mental health, making you vulnerable to anxiety and depression. If you are unable to understand, get comfortable with, or manage your emotions, you’ll also struggle to form strong relationships. This in turn can leave you feeling lonely and isolated and further exacerbate any mental health problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your relationships. By understanding your emotions and how to control them, you’re better able to express how you feel and understand how others are feeling. This allows you to communicate more effectively and forge stronger relationships, both at work and in your personal life.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your social intelligence. Being in tune with your emotions serves a social purpose, connecting you to other people and the world around you. Social intelligence enables you to recognize friend from foe, measure another person’s interest in you, reduce stress, balance your nervous system through social communication, and feel loved and happy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is there any potential pitfalls?</h2>
    <p>Being low on emotional intelligence can have a number of drawbacks, but having a very high level of emotional skills can also come with challenges. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Research suggests that people with high emotional intelligence may actually be less creative and innovative.
        </li>
        <li>
          Highly emotionally intelligent people may have a hard time delivering negative feedback for fear of hurting other people's  feelings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Research has found that high EQ can sometimes be used for manipulative and deceptive purposes.
        </li>
    </ul>
